\f0\fs24 \cf0 Before you see this assignment, I have to say I am very sorry about it. It does not match with the criteria. I know we are not supposed to be using the original pacman idea, but I had run out of time to do the assignment (completely my fault) and didn\'92t have time to ideate anymore. The maps and ghosts, although resemble closely to the original are made using piskel, not taken from google or any other online sources. I will make sure that I can submit a great game for Assignment 4 and will revamp this whole thing. }
